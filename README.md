# fake_news_agent
This project builds an agentic fake-news detection system that determines whether a news article or social media post contains real or fake information. The system will combine text classification, OCR (for image inputs), and evidence-based reasoning to produce a label on the introduced dataset, along with clear explanations as to why it was labeled real/fake/unverifiable. 
The agent will operate in the domain of digital news and/or social media content. It will require knowledge of news (such as reputable news outlets and fact0checking databases). It also relies on NLP. ML classification models, and OCR technology for imae-based text extraction.
Target users for this project may include studemts, social media users, educators, and other people who want to verify the credibility of the content they are consuming. Users would be able to upload an article or screenshot and ask the system whether the information is real or fake. The agent would respond with a classification of the real/fakeness of the submission, and provide reasoning explaining how it got to that conclusion.
